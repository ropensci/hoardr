`hoard` - manage cached files

Exposes a single `R6` object so that when the package is imported in another
package for managing cached files, you don't need to pollute the NAMESPACE
with a bunch of functions. (you can always just `hoardr::fxn`, but
with a single object there are other benefits as well [maintaining state, e.g.]).
